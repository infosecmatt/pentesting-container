# Penetration Testing Docker Container
This is the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file for the pentesting container I've set up.

Lately I've been experimenting with the idea of utilizing containers for performing pentests and CTF challenges as opposed to VMs. The principal benefits of this are, in my opinion, performance, ease of use, and consistency. The base image (which is not yet fully complete) has all of the tools that I commonly need and is configured how I like it. 

The docker-compose file deploys the image into containers with a few key configurations:
- Shared host networking. While this isn't necessarily considered best practices from a dev point of view, for the purposes of a pentesting container this is desired behavior. I'm never exactly sure which ports I will need available to the outside world, and due to my hardened host OS I am confident in the fact that all ports I expose are within the isolated namespace. As an added bonus, for things like HackTheBox where I need to use a VPN, the container will work with it right out of the box.
- The ability to run gui applications from within the container. I don't necessarily need them often, but it's good to know that in the event I want to use something like Bloodhound or Burpsuite I don't have to do any trickery to get it to work.
- Mounted volume for saving collected evidence/data. This is obviously useful for CTF writeups and pentests/vulnerability assessments.

This project is still in progress. I have been fascinated with the described benefits of containerization, and this project has given me some applicable knowledge in the tools/tech while still having tangible benefits related to my hobbies (i.e. pentesting/hacking).
